# zenoh_ros2trial

Quick trial a.k.a practice to learn the marriage of ROS 2 and Zenoh :D

This repository provides the instructions for demonstrations presented in [ROSJP#54](https://rosjp.connpass.com/event/304753/) ([SpkearDeck (T.B.A)](https://speakerdeck.com/takasehideki/)).
The operation of this repository is mainly confirmed on my M1 Mac (arm64) machine.
Please let me know if anyone has managed to get it to work on an x64 (amd64) machine.
Also, if you have any problems (especially on x64 (amd64) machines), please feel free to let me know via [Issues](https://github.com/takasehideki/zenoh_trial/issues).

In a nutshell, I hope you will reproduce them and confirm the awesome power of Zenoh for ROS 2 ecosystem ASAP!
